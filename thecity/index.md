## History

In the 18th Century Belfast came to prominence as an industrial centre and merchant city. It's location atthe head of the Belfast Lough helped the shipyards flourish, at one point employing over 35,000 men. And it was a Belfast shipyard, Harland & Wolff, that built the world-renowned SS Titanic, which is commemorated by the stunning Titanic Centre, where we have dinner on the Thursday night of the Conference.

## Technology

However, industries change and Belfast is once again flourishing as a technology hub, and home to globally recognised technology companies such as BlackDuck Software, WhiteHat Security, Allstate and many other tech giants attracted by the availability of world-class talent and easy access to the UK, Irish and European markets.

## Arts

With a population of less than 1.8 million it may come as a surprise that Northern Ireland has produced some of the world’s best known playwrights, poets and performers. CS Lewis, Ciaran Hinds, Liam Neeson, Michael Longley, Kenneth Branagh and Seamus Heaney are to name but a few of our local talents.

## Welcoming

In 2011, Trip Advisor named Belfast as the "Best Value City in the UK" and Mercer.com established Belfast as having the lowest cost of living. This, along with Civic Hospitality ensures that delegates will experience the best experience whilst keeping the conference within budget.

## Investment

Over a billion pounds has been invested in Belfast over the past decade and as a result, our city is fast becoming the destination of choice for national and international event organisers. The Financial Times recently listed Belfast as one of the Top 10 places in the world to host a conference and TripAdvisor users have just voted the city as one of the "Top 10 destinations on the rise" across Europe.
