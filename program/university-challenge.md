This years UC is a two stage challenge:

* Day 1: Capture The Flag (CtF), solving hacking challenges.
* Day 2: Offense/Defense (Blue/Red Team), defending your vulnerable web application whilst attacking the application of the other teams

This year the OWASP University Challenge will be limited to 10 teams. Teams will consist of 4-8 students, with one team per university. All team openings are on a first come first serve basis. If multiple teams are received from the same university the second team will be put on a wait list.
